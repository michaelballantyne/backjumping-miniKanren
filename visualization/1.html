<h2>Justification for min-jump</h2>

<p>If the unification in version 5 fails, we don't want it to report version 4 as the reason for failure, even if the unification in version 4 is involved. That's because in all executions in which the unification at version 5 occurs, so does the one at version 4. So to make unification at 5 succeed, we need to change something else - perhaps the unification at version 1.</p>
