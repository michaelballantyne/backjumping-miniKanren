<h2>A broken idea for min jump</h2>

<p>Will asked why we couldn't just not put a version number on unifications made in a position that appears to be in the direct left hand side of a conjunction in order to achieve the same as min-jup. We can't do that because there may be another conjunction at a higher level that will use that unification as a jump target, even if it shouldn't be a target for elements in the RHS of the nearest conjunction. The unification in version 1 below is a good example.</p>

visualize(
    conj(
        disj(
            conj(
                uni,
                disj(
                    uni,
                    dot
                )
            ),
            dot
        ),
        uni
    )
);
